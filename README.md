# CareEase 🌿

Imagine a world where caregivers and families feel **confident, connected, and in control** of elderly care. Welcome to **CareEase**, a web app inspired by **UN SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-being**, designed to make caregiving smoother, smarter, and more reassuring.

> 🩺 *Demo Scenario:* Mary is 72 (demo profile). Her caregiver, Jane, logs her BP and medication with CareEase, while her daughter checks the dashboard in real-time. CareEase keeps everyone informed and stress-free.
